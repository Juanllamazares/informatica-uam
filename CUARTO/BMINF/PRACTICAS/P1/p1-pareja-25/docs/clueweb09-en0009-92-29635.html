			<h2>Peace College Announces $30 Million Fundraising Campaign</h2>
			<div class="cnt-txt">
									<img src="/files/2008/10/17/promise_logo_web.jpg" class="txt-img-right" alt="" />
								<p>RALEIGH, N.C. (Oct. 17, 2008) - Peace College on Friday unveiled the largest fundraising campaign in the college's history - the $30 million Promise of Peace Campaign. The college already has raised more than $20 million toward the campaign's goal.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The Promise of Peace Campaign seeks to raise funds to help fulfill the transformation of Peace that began more than a decade ago when the leadership of the college adopted the ambition of becoming a baccalaureate college, said President Laura Bingham.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>  <p>&quot;We launch the public phase of this campaign with the knowledge that our community and its supporters have much to give to Peace College to benefit the students of today and of tomorrow,&quot; said President Laura Bingham. &quot;This campaign builds on the support we've enjoyed since moving to baccalaureate status in 1995, with the expectation that continued investments will allow us to extend the benefits of Peace in increasingly meaningful and powerful ways.&quot;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>  <p>The public phase of the campaign was launched Friday with an event that included lunch on the college's front lawn, student performances and presentations, and a special lighting of the college's historic Main Building. The college also held a ceremonial groundbreaking ceremony for the $3.7 million renovation and expansion of the college's Lucy Cooper Finch Library, a project being funded with Promise of Peace donations.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>  <p>The college also announced that an anonymous donor had pledged a $500,000 gift to the Promise of Peace Campaign, pushing the total raised so far past $20 million. The donation was the ninth gift of $500,000 or more given during the campaign so far.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>  <p>Bingham introduced the co-chairs of the campaign: Lou Willett Mitchell, a 1962 graduate of Peace, and her husband, Burley Mitchell, Jr., a former chief justice of the North Carolina Supreme Court whose mother and grandmother both attended Peace.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>  <p>&quot;We are pleased to join this campaign, to support a college that has demonstrated great accomplishment in educating women from the state capital and beyond for many years,&quot; said Burley Mitchell. &quot;Peace has had great success during the last decade with student and academic achievements. We look forward to working with other volunteer leaders to advance the college's transformation.&quot;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>  <p>Serving as vice-chairs are Susan Barnes Lilly, a 1991 Peace graduate, and her husband, Steven C. Lilly, chief financial officer of Triangle Capital Corporation, a Raleigh-based business development company.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>  <p>In conjunction with the Promise of Peace Campaign announcement activities, the college on Friday awarded the William Peace Medallion, the college's highest honor, to the A.E. Finley Foundation. The honor was in recognition of the foundation's support for Peace, represented by more than $1.6 million in gifts since the 1960s.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>  <p>Some additional facts about the Promise of Peace Campaign:</p>  <ul class="unIndentedList"><li> The Promise of Peace Campaign was launched in the fall of 2004. It has raised $20.45 million.</li><li> The campaign is raising funds for construction and renovation projects, endowments for scholarships, professorships and other programs, and other funding for student and faculty support programs.</li><li> The campaign has raised $11 million for new endowments.</li><li> The college has received three gifts or pledges of $1 million or more, six gifts or pledges of $500,000, seven gifts or pledges of $250,000, and more than 30 gifts of $100,000. </li><li> Giving to the college's annual fund reached a record $522,000 last year, surpassing the previous record by more than 10 percent. </li><li> Prior to this campaign, Peace College's largest fundraising campaign was the &quot;Pathways to Excellence&quot; campaign, which was completed in 2000, raising more than $15 million.</li></ul><br />            <p>The public phase of the campaign is being launched after a successful fundraising drive among trustees and members of the college's other boards raised $7.5 million in gifts and pledges.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>  <p>&quot;Our unprecedented success in gaining support from the college's leadership groups speaks strongly to the strength of support Peace enjoys,&quot; Bingham said.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>  <p>Recent turmoil in financial markets would not keep the college from moving forward with the campaign, Bingham said.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>  <p>&quot;We are mindful of the uncertainty of the financial markets, but our first donors in the last few years have shown considerable confidence and generosity,&quot; she said. &quot;We must honor their commitment to Peace and move forward with this important campaign and the significant investments it promises.&quot;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>  <p>Among the projects being funded by Promise of Peace gifts is the renovation and expansion of Peace's Lucy Cooper Finch Library, located on the front of campus facing Peace Street. A ceremonial groundbreaking for the project was held Friday afternoon. Giving to the project has been led by brothers Fin Gaddy of Manteo and Will Gaddy of Whistler, Canada, grandsons of the library's original benefactor for whom the building is named. Martin Marietta made the first gift for the library and the Cannon Foundation recently made a grant of $200,000 for the project.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>  <p>The library project will add 2,100 square feet to the building and refashion the facility into a modern learning center featuring a &quot;learning commons&quot; with computer stations and workspaces where students can conduct research and study together. The college's learning services programs will move into the renovated building, as will information technology support staff, bringing into one building a variety of student academic services. The project is expected to be completed in fall 2009, 40 years after its construction.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>  <p>&quot;The library renovation and expansion represents just one of the important investments Peace is making, and expects to make, with Promise of Peace funds to bolster our academic program,&quot; said Michael Magoon, vice president of development and alumnae affairs. &quot;We also plan science laboratory renovations and other campaign-funded projects that are intended to enhance the academic and social offerings Peace extends to its students.&quot;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>  <p>Peace College is a four-year baccalaureate arts and sciences college that offers a challenging program of study that provides women strong intellectual and personal foundations upon which to build successful and meaningful professional and academic careers. Peace's educational program regularly earns high evaluations in the National Survey of Student Engagement.
