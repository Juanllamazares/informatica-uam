		Elisha Mitchell was born in Washington, Connecticut on August 19<sup>th</sup>, 
		1793.&nbsp; His parents were Abner Mitchell and Phoebe Eliot, who were local 
		farmers.&nbsp; Mitchell attended a school in Bethlehem, Conn., run by 
		Reverend Azel Backus. &nbsp;He graduated from Yale in 1813, where he had 
		studied under Professor Benjamin Silliman.&nbsp; Mitchell then taught for a 
		time at Union Hall Academy in Jamaica, Long Island, and spent a while as 
		the principal of Union Academy in New London, Connecticut. &nbsp;In 1816 he 
		returned to Yale as a tutor.&nbsp; In 1817 he spent about a year in Andover 
		theological seminary and was licensed to preach by the Congregationalist 
		Western Association of New Haven County, Conn.&nbsp; In 1818 he then went to 
		the University of North Carolina as the professor of mathematics and 
		natural philosophy. &nbsp;Mitchell had been recommended for the post by U.S. 
		Senate Chaplain Sereno Dwight.</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in"><font color="#000000">In 
		1819 Mitchell married Maria Sybil North, eventually having seven 
		children, Mary, Ellen, Margaret, Matthew, Eliza, Charles, and Henry.&nbsp; 
		Both Matthew and Henry died as children.&nbsp; Mitchell had his future wife 
		while teaching at Union Academy, and after he had moved to North 
		Carolina he returned to Connecticut for a short time to marry her.&nbsp; 
		After this he rarely visited the north, traveling there only for family 
		reasons. &nbsp;Mitchell and his wife owned a home near the University and 
		owned a small family of slaves.&nbsp; Mitchell had his daughters classically 
		educated and supported the education of women.&nbsp; In 1834 he pushed for a 
		tax-supported public education system.&nbsp; He believed that an educated 
		society was a better society and that the system would provide jobs for 
		women as teachers.&nbsp; He also supported the temperance movement.&nbsp; In 1846 
		Mitchell was appointed by Governor William A. Graham to survey a 
		turnpike running from Raleigh to Buncombe County.&nbsp; Mitchell supported 
		the turnpike, believing that the increased trade and travel between the 
		eastern and western portions of the state would help to materially 
		improve the mountain area, which he believed was economically 
		disadvantaged and in need of the influences of civilization.</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in"><font color="#000000">He 
		was ordained in Hillsborough, N.C., in the Presbyterian Church in the 
		year of 1821.&nbsp; After his ordination Mitchell frequently guided the 
		university chapel and sometimes spoke at local churches as well. 
		&nbsp;Mitchell also conducted a long dispute through the Raleigh newspaper 
		with John Stark Ravenscroft in 1825.&nbsp; Ravenscroft was an Episcopal 
		bishop who had more liberal views than the strict Mitchell.&nbsp; The Bishop 
		supported tradition as a source of Christian truth, while Mitchell 
		argued that literal interpretations of the Bible were the only Christian 
		truth.&nbsp; In 1848 he grounded his defense of slavery on literal 
		interpretations of the Bible and claimed in a pamphlet that the Bible 
		did not refer to slavery as a sin. </font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in"><font color="#000000">&nbsp;In 
		1825 he became the professor of chemistry, mineralory, and geology, a 
		position he would hold until his death.&nbsp; When Joseph Caldwell, the 
		university president, died, Mitchell took the position of faculty 
		president until a new president could be found.&nbsp; Mitchell also was the 
		University bursar, collecting tuition and making sure the University 
		grounds and buildings were taken care of.&nbsp; He had served at this post 
		for some time before being officially chosen for it in 1837.&nbsp; For many 
		years he held the office of state surveyor and visited the mountains of 
		North Carolina on his vacation time. &nbsp;In 1838 Mitchell received a 
		doctoral degree from the University of Alabama.&nbsp; Throughout his life 
		Mitchell published various articles, mostly about geology in the 
		merican Journal of Science,edited by Benjamin Silliman, a former 
		teacher of Mitchell.&nbsp; </font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in"><font color="#000000">
		Through the late 1820 Mitchell completed a geological survey of North 
		Carolina begun by Denison Olmsted, who had been a classmate at Yale.&nbsp; 
		When the state stopped giving the survey money he focused on the western 
		part of the state, persuaded by John Caldwell Calhoun that the 
		Appalachian Mountains were the highest in the eastern U.S.&nbsp; Mitchell 
		confirmed this idea in 1835 when he measured Black Mountain.&nbsp; His claim 
		that Black Mountain was the highest peak in the east of the Rocky Mts. 
		was disputed by Thomas Clingman.&nbsp; The two men kept up a public argument 
		for some time, this eventually becoming the indirect cause of Mitchell 
		death.&nbsp; Believing that Black Dome was the highest point he re-measured 
		it in 1835, 1838, 1844, and 1857.&nbsp; The last time he went to measure the 
		mountain he left his party to go and visit the man who had been his 
		guide in 1835.&nbsp; It started to storm while he was climbing and he fell 
		down a waterfall, drowning in a pool at the bottom.</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in"><font color="#000000">
		Mitchell was first buried in Asheville, but in 1858 due to the feelings 
		of western North Carolinians he was re-entombed on the highest point of 
		the mountain he had spent so much time on, Black Mt. &nbsp;A large crowd was 
		there to see him interred and Bishop Otey of Tennessee spoke at the 
		ceremony. &nbsp;Mitchell was proved to be right in 1882 when the U.S. 
		Geological Survey determined that Black Mountain, which they renamed Mt. 
		Mitchell, was the highest point east of the Rocky Mountains. &nbsp;&nbsp;There is 
		a memorial plaque and an observation tower to mark his grave and the 
		area surrounding it is now a state park.&nbsp; In 1883 the Elisha Mitchell 
		scientific society was created at Chapel Hill in honor of his 
		accomplishments.<br>

		<p><font face="Times New Roman" color="#000000">Dr. Elisha Mitchell was born in 
		Washington, Connecticut, on August 19, 1793. His family was of &quot;early 
		colonial parentage,&quot; and one of his great-grandfathers was John Eliot, 
		the famous &quot;Apostle to the Indians.&quot; (<i>1905. Ashe, Samuel. <u>A 
		Biographical History of North Carolina</u>. Vol. I, p. 384.)</i></font></p>
		<p><font face="Times New Roman" color="#000000">Dr. Mitchell was a &quot;precocious&quot; 
		boy. He studied under the tutelage of Rev. Azel Backus until he attended 
		Yale College. He graduated in 1813 &quot;being particularly distinguished for 
		his knowledge of English literature.&quot; (<i>1905. Ashe, Samuel.<u> A 
		Biographical History of North Carolina</u>. Vol. I, p.385.)</i><u>
		</u></font></p>
		<p><font face="Times New Roman" color="#000000">After leaving Yale, Dr. Mitchell 
		went to Jamaica, Long Island, where he taught at a boy's school. In 
		1815, he was placed in charge of a girl's school in New London. He was 
		there for a year and then went back to Yale and served as a tutor at the 
		college. Shortly after he accepted the position at Yale, however, Judge 
		Gaston, who was an influential member of Congress, recommended Dr. 
		Mitchell for the position of chair of mathematics at the University of 
		North Carolina. In 1817, Dr. Mitchell accepted the position. (<i>1905. 
		Ashe, Samuel. <u>A Biographical History of North Carolina</u>. Vol. 
		I, p.385).</i></font></p>
		<p><font face="Times New Roman" color="#000000">After accepting the position at 
		North Carolina, Dr. Mitchell &quot;spent a short time at the Theological 
		Seminary at Andover, and received his license to preach the Gospel from 
		an Orthodox Congregational Association in Connecticut.&quot; Dr. Mitchell 
		used this training during his time at the university, for &quot;Soon after 
		his arrival Dr. Mitchell preached his first sermon in the college 
		chapel, and three years later he was ordained as a full minister by the 
		Presbytery of Orange, and he continued to preach at Chapel Hill during 
		his entire life.&quot; (<i>1905. Ashe, Samuel. <u>A Biographical History of 
		North Carolina</u>. Vol. I, pp.385, 386.)</i></font></p>
		<p><font face="Times New Roman" color="#000000">Dr. Mitchell arrived at the 
		University of North Carolina on January 31, 1818. He joined the other 
		faculty members, consisting of Dr. Caldwell, the president, Dr. Olmsted, 
		professor of chemistry, Dr. Hooper, professor of ancient languages, and 
		two tutors, Governor Morehead and Priestly H. Magnum. There were 120 
		students attending the university. Dr. Mitchell was responsible for 
		teaching mathematics and natural philosophy. &quot;He was devoted to his profession as an instructor, and in
        discharge of his duties he exhibited an energy, an intelligence, a self
        denial and an attention to minute particulars seldom equalled [sic] and never
        surpassed....For seven years he continued to preside over his original
        department, but in 1825 when Dr. Olmsted accepted a position with Yale
        College, Dr. Mitchell was transferred to the vacated chair, and Dr.
        Phillips became professor of mathematics.&quot; (<i>1905.
        Ashe, Samuel. <u>A Biographical History of North Carolina</u>. Vol.
        I, pp. 385, 386</i>.)</font></p>
		<p><font face="Times New Roman" color="#000000">Part of Dr. Olmstead's 
		responsibilities had been his commissioning by the state of North 
		Carolina to make a geological survey of the entire state. Dr. Mitchell 
		eagerly carried on this task, for it &quot;had ever been particularly 
		inviting&quot; to him, since his &quot;tastes led him to employ himself in such 
		pursuits. Even while a professor of mathematics, he made many pedestrian 
		excursions through the country studying botany, and when he began his 
		instruction in mineralogy and geology he multiplied these excursions, 
		and formed an intimate acquaintance with the botany and geology of the 
		state.&quot; (<i>1905. Ashe, Samuel. <u>A Biographical History of North 
		Carolina</u>. Vol. I, pp. 386, 387).</i>&nbsp; </font></p>
        <p><font color="#000000" face="Times New Roman">Dr. Mitchell began to take trips 
		around the state in order to collect information for his survey. &quot;In 
		June, 1830, he accompanied Governor Owen and the other members of the 
		Board of Internal Improvements and Governor Swain on a trip from Haywood 
		down the Cape Fear to Fayetteville, and availed himself of the 
		opportunity of obtaining more particular knowledge of the geology of 
		that interesting part of the country. When those distinguished naturalists, the Michaux, were in
        Western North Carolina, toward the close of the previous century, they
        had believed that the peaks of Black Mountain were the highest east of
        the Rocky Mountains, that conclusion being reached because the plants
        found there are not met with again until Canada is reached.&nbsp; Vice
        President Calhoun had suggested in 1825 to Gov. Swain the same view,
        based on the water-courses, and Dr. Mitchell also entertained the same
        opinion.&quot; (<i>1905. Ashe, Samuel. <u>A Biographical History of North
        Carolina</u>. Vol. I, p. 387</i>.)</font></p>
        <p><font color="#000000" face="Times New Roman">Dr. Mitchell set out in the summer 
		of 1835 to test his and other people's opinions that the Black Mountains 
		were the highest peaks east of the Mississippi River. He set out to do 
		this by barometrical measurement.&quot; In doing so, he showed great 
		patience, energy, and perserverance, for &quot;To climb the Black
        Mountain and carry up the instruments to determine its height in 1835
        required courage and scientific ardor to an unusual degree. The country,
        naturally savage, was at that time very little known.&nbsp; It was much
        more inaccessible than it has since become by reason of the progress of
        settlements around its base; but Dr. Mitchell overcame all difficulties,
        and he found the height of one of the peaks to be 6476 feet, while Mount 
		Washington in New Hampshire, long considered he highest point of the 
		Alleghanies, is only 6428 feet high.&nbsp; Dr. Mitchell's account of this exploration was published,
        and attracted wide attention.&nbsp; It was the first authoritative
        announcement that Black Mountain was higher than the White Mountains
        [NH] and indeed, the highest in the United States east of the Rockies.&quot; (<i>1905.
        Ashe, Samuel. <u>A Biographical History of North Carolina</u>. Vol.
        I, pp.387, 388</i>.)</font></p>
		<p><font face="Times New Roman" color="#000000">In 1844, Dr. Mitchell returned to 
		the Black Mountains, this time looking for the tallest peak of all. He 
		succeeded, and &quot;In recognition of his discovery, his name was attached to a
        peak of the mountain on the maps and geographies of that period.&quot; (<i>1905. 
		Ashe, Samuel. <u>A Biographical History of North Carolina</u>. Vol. 
		I, p.388.)</i></font></p>
		<p><font face="Times New Roman" color="#000000">There was controversy over this 
		decision, however. Thomas Clingman asserted that Dr. Mitchell had 
		measured the wrong mountain but that he himself had correctly measured 
		the highest mountain in the Black Mountains. Some people then suggested 
		that Mount Mitchell's name be changed to Mount Clingman. Dr. Mitchell 
		&quot;contended that he was the first to measure and ascertain its superior 
		height, and that he was on that very peak and had measured it in 1844.&quot;
		<i>(1905. Ashe, Samuel. <u>A Biographical History of North Carolina</u>. Vol. 
		I, p.388.)</i></font></p>
		<p><font face="Times New Roman" color="#000000">Dr. Mitchell then announced his 
		intentions to return to the Black Mountains in order to re-measure the 
		peak and prove that he had been on Mount Mitchell in 1844 by gathering 
		statements from the men who had acted as his guides in that year. He 
		went back in June 1857 with his son, Charles A. Mitchell. He worked for 
		two weeks. On Sunday, June 27, he quit work at 2:30 in the afternoon, 
		&quot;proposing to cross the mountain to the
        settlement on Caney River for the purpose of seeing Mr. [Tom] Wilson and
        others who had guided him to the top on a former visit.&nbsp; He
        promised to return on Monday at noon.&nbsp; This was the last time he was
        ever seen alive.&quot; (<i>1905. Ashe, Samuel.<u> A Biographical History of
        North Carolina</u>. Vol. I, p. 389</i>.)</font></p>
		<p><font face="Times New Roman" color="#000000">When Dr. Mitchell did not return 
		from his visit by Thursday morning, one member of his party went to Mr. 
		Wilson's house in an attempt to track Dr. Mitchell down. When it was 
		discovered that Dr. Mitchell had never reached the Wilson home, a search 
		party was organized. &quot; The alarm was at once given, and before sundown 
		on Friday evening companies of hardy mountaineers were on their way up 
		the mountain. As the alarm spread, many citizens of Asheville and other 
		parts of the country flocked to the mountains to assist in the search 
		for one so universally beloved and respected. On the night of the 
		following Tuesday his remains were found. Mr. Wilson surmised that Dr. 
		Mitchell had attempted to follow the same route that he had taken in 
		1844, but had strayed from it. They traced him down the precipices of 
		the mountain until they reached a stream, found his traces going down to 
		it a hundred yards or so, when they came to a rushing cataract some 
		forty feet high. Here they saw his footprints trying to climb around the 
		edge of the yawning precipice, and then the moss torn up as he had 
		grasped in vain. Descending hastily to the bottom of the roaring abyss, 
		they found a basin fourteen feet deep filled with clear and crystal 
		waters, and at the bottom, quietly reposing with outstretched arms, lay 
		the mortal remains of Dr. Mitchell, the great, the good, the wise, the 
		simple-minded, the pure of heart, instructor of youth, disciple of 
		knowledge, and the preacher of Christianity.&quot; (<i>1905. Ashe, Samuel. <u>
		A Biographical History of North Carolina</u>. Vol. I, p. 389).</i>
		</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman" color="#000000">Dr. Mitchell's body was taken by 
		fifty of the citizens of Yancey County, where Mount Mitchell is located, 
		to Asheville, where he was buried. His bones did not remain there long, 
		however, for &quot;It having been determined that Dr. Mitchell's remains should
        finally rest on the highest peak of the Black Mountains, on the 14th of
        June 1858, they were exhumed and attended by a large concourse of
        citizens, by the venerable bishop of the diocese of Tennessee, the
        president of the University and members of his family, the body was
        borne to the summit of the mountain, and Bishop Otey read the impressive
        burial service of the Episcopal Church; and since that time a
        substantial monument has been erected over the spot; the altitude by
        more recent measurement being determined to be 6717 feet high. (<i>1905.
        Ashe, Samuel. <u>A Biographical History of North Carolina</u>. Vol.
        I, pp. 389, 390</i>.)</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman" color="#000000">Dr. Mitchell's death was mourned 
		by the whole state. &quot;As a man, he was greatly esteemed, filling many functions most
        acceptably.&nbsp; He was the college bursar; he was the justice of the
        peace, a farmer, a commissioner for the village of Chapel Hill, and at
        times its magistrate of police; and he was a regular preacher in the
        college chapel and in the village church. In the public he often gave 
		evidence of the vast extent of his learning, while his blameless life, 
		his humble faith, drew him near to the hearts of all. As a teacher, Dr. 
		Mitchell took great pains in inculcating the first principles of science 
		and unfolding those natural truths of which he was so fond. His 
		acquirements extended into every field of learning, and so accurate and 
		vast was his information that he was often referred to as the 'College 
		Encyclopedia.' Under his training, such interest was awakened in natural 
		science among the students that in this respect a great benefit was 
		conferred upon the State. As a disciplinarian, he was vigilant, 
		conscientious, long-suffering, firm and mild....In his home he was 
		venerated as well&nbsp; as beloved.&nbsp; Besides his work in the
        college, and other duties of a public nature, he educated his own
        children, and especially were his daughters educated to a degree not
        often attempted....He left five children, four daughters and
        one son, Dr. Charles A Mitchell, who became a surgeon in the Confederate
        army, and surviving the war, died in 1868.&quot; (<i>1905. Ashe, Samuel.

        <p><font face="Times New Roman" color="#000000">&quot;Still, the heights of the Carolina peaks have been taken (with
        but one exception, so far as I know) only by barometric measurements,
        and these, even though official, may vary as much as a hundred feet for the
        same mountain. Since the highest ten or a dozen of our Carolina peaks
        differ in altitude only one or two hundred feet, their actual rank has
        not yet been determined. (<i>1913. Kephardt, Horace. <u>Our Southern
        Highlanders</u>. pp. 56, 57</i>.)</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman" color="#000000">&quot;For a long time there was controversy as to whether Mount
        Mitchell or Clingman Dome was the crowning summit of Eastern
        America.&nbsp; The Coast and Geodetic Survey gave the height of Mount
        Mitchell as 6,688 feet; but later figures of the U. S. Geological
        Survey are 6,711 and 6,712.&nbsp; In 1859 Buckley claimed for Clingman
        Dome of the Smokies an altitude of 6,941 feet.&nbsp; In recent
        government reports the Dome appears variously as 6,619 and
        6,660.&nbsp;&nbsp; In 1911 I was told by Mr. H. M. Ramseur that when he
        laid out the route of the railroad from Asheville to Murphy he ran a
        line of levels from a known datum on this road to the top of Clingman,
        and that the result was 'four sixes' (6,666 feet above sea-level).&nbsp;
        It is probably that second place among the peaks of Appalachia may
        belong either to Clingman Dome or Guyot or LeConte, of the Smokies, or
        to Balsam Cone of the Black Mountains.&quot; (<i>1913. Kephardt, Horace.

      <font face="Times New Roman" color="#000000">&quot;....The path is wet
        and muddy in places, and also steep, but at last you pass up out of the
        dark balsams into a sunny meadow where blue eyebrights look up from the
        grass, and from which a stony trail bordered with rose-bay leads through
        stunted firs to the open top, where a monument standing alone on the
        very summit of the mountain give a feeling of solemnity to the
        place.&nbsp; It was erected here in 1888 to the memory, as the legend on
        the side reads, of the &quot;Rev. Elisha Mitchell, D.D., who after being
        for thirty-nine years a professor in the University of North Carolina,
        lost his life in the scientific exploration of this mountain, in the
        sixty-fourth year of his age, June 27th, 1857.&quot; (<i>1913. Morley,
        Margaret. <u>The Carolina Mountains</u>. p. 309</i>.)</font><p>
      <font face="Times New Roman" color="#000000">&quot;Dr.
        Mitchell, being greatly attached to the mountain, then called Black
        Dome, and convinced that it was the highest in the Appalachians, had
        often been to the top to make his observations and prove his
        theory.&nbsp; One day he went up alone and did not return at the
        appointed time....The search, led by several old bear hunters, was
        finally given up when Dr. Mitchell's son, according to Big Tom, said to
        the men, &quot;I give you a thousand thanks, but please hunt again
        tomorrow.&quot; (<i>1913. Morley, Margaret. <u>The Carolina Mountains</u>.
        pp. 309, 310</i>.)</font><p>
		<font face="Times New Roman" color="#000000">&quot;The first trace was found eleven days after
        the disappearance, when Big Tom, sure of signs that no one less
        experienced in woodcraft could have seen, the mark of heel-tacks on a
        root, a stone displaced, weeds bent, a mark on a rotten log, went from
        point to point until he saw the missing man's hat on a log by a
        streamside.&nbsp; Above was a deep pool at the foot of a waterfall--the
        hat had floated down from there....&quot;I yelled and they answered
        me.&nbsp; They came on. 'I've found his hat.' They all huddled up. And I
        walked on a log and saw him.&nbsp; 'Come around, boys, poor old feller,
        here he is.&quot;...and old Tom's voice breaks and the tears are
        streaming down his face. Dr. Mitchell, although so well acquainted with
        the mountain, was believed to have become lost in a fog and to have
        fallen over the precipice above the cataract whose icy water kept the
        body in perfect condition until it was found.&nbsp; It was finally
        buried on the summit of the mountain so dear to him, and whose name was
        changed in his honor. (<i>1913. Morley, </i>Margaret<i>. <u>The Carolina Mountains</u>.

        Elisha Mitchell made the first barometrical measurements of our
        mountains, and his report was the first authoritative announcement of
        the superior altitude of the highest southern summit to that of Mount

        <p><font color="#000000" face="Times New Roman">&quot;<u>The Monument</u>. The monument to Prof. Elisha Mitchell on
        the crest of the highest peak east of the Rocky mountains, was completed
        August 18, 1888. It is bolted to the bed-rock itself, is of white
        bronze, an almost pure zinc, treated under the sandblast to impart a
        granular appearance, cause it to resemble granite, and prevent
        discoloration; and was made by the Monumental Bronze Company of
        Bridgeport, Conn.&nbsp; It was erected by Mrs. E. N. Grant, a daughter,
        and other members of Prof. Mitchell's family.&nbsp; Its dimensions are
        about two and one-half feet at the base and about twelve feet high. It
        is a hollow square and without any ornamentation.&nbsp; Vandals have
        shot bullet holes in it and an ax blade has been driven into one of its
        sides.&nbsp; Prof. W. B. Phillips, now the professor of Geology at the
        University of Texas, had charge of its erection.&nbsp; It contains the
        following inscriptions: Upon the western side, in raised letters is the
        single word: MITCHELL.&nbsp; On the side toward the grave is the
        following:&nbsp; Erected in 1888. Here lies in hope of a blessed
        resurrection the body of Rev. Elisha Mitchell, D. D., who, after being
        for 39 years a professor in the University of North Carolina, lost his
        life in the scientific exploration of this mountain in the 64th year of
        his age, June 27th, 1857. (<i>1914. Arthur, John. <u>Western North
