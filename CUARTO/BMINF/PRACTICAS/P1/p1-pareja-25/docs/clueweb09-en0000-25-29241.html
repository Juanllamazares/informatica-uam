 	                                <p>Can reading a book change your life? Yes. If you take the actions that the author suggests in the book. Simply reading and absorbing the information in an organizing book (or any other self-improvement book for that matter) will only change your outlook and knowledge on the topic. Without getting up out of your chair and taking action on what you just read&your home wont be any more organized. </p>
<p>In the next couple of posts I plan to share some of my favorite organizing books. If youre looking to get more organized and you love to do-it-yourself, books are an excellent tool in your organizers tool bag, especially if youre self motivated. In other words, books work really well if you can get yourself up off that chair and start taking action!</p>
<p>Today Ill share one of my very favorite organizing books, <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0743292642?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=simp101inc-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0743292642">It&#39;s All Too Much: An Easy Plan for Living a Richer Life with Less Stuff</a><img alt="" border="0" height="1" src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=simp101inc-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=0743292642" style="BORDER-RIGHT: medium none; BORDER-TOP: medium none; MARGIN: 0px; BORDER-LEFT: medium none; BORDER-BOTTOM: medium none" width="1" /> </em>by Peter Walsh. </p>
<p>&#0160;<span id="fck_dom_range_temp_1231340221552_17"></span><span id="fck_dom_range_temp_1231340221554_229"></span><a href="http://creativeorganizing.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c3c0f53ef010536b08196970b-pi" style="DISPLAY: inline"><img alt="Its_All_Too_Much" class="at-xid-6a00d8341c3c0f53ef010536b08196970b " src="http://creativeorganizing.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c3c0f53ef010536b08196970b-500wi" /></a> </p>
<p></p>
<p>The reason this book ranks at the top of my list is because it is so inspiring. You literally want to jump up out of your seat and start eliminating the clutter now! And you want to really dig deep into the depths of that clutter and just let it all go. Peter also provides excellent advice for navigating through the organizing process with a loved-one. If you share your home with someone who has a different tolerance level for clutter than you do, Peter offers excellent advice on how to broach this subject with your loved-one and make progress together. </p>
<p>If youre looking for a book to kick-start your organizing efforts and motivate you to really declutter your home, give <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0743292642?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=simp101inc-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0743292642">It&#39;s All Too Much</a><img alt="" border="0" height="1" src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=simp101inc-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=0743292642" style="BORDER-RIGHT: medium none; BORDER-TOP: medium none; MARGIN: 0px; BORDER-LEFT: medium none; BORDER-BOTTOM: medium none" width="1" /> </em>a try. Its an enjoyable read in and of itself, but even more so if you can imagine Peter is speaking to you in his oh-so wonderful Australian accent. ;)</p>
<p>Whats your favorite organizing book? How did it change your life or your approach to organizing? Id love to hear. </p>

The time period from Halloween until New Year&#39;s Eve is just jam-packed. Sure it&#39;s packed with really fun stuff...but it&#39;s packed none the less.</font></span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13px; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"><font face="Verdana">But when January hits...the calendar is a bit more manageable. Plus, its the season of resolutions and getting organized.&#0160;I&#39;m completely in my element. ;) </font></span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13px; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"><font face="Verdana">So how about you...do you welcome the arrival of January and the New Year with open arms like I do? Do you set resolutions? Do yours involve getting organized?</font></span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13px; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"><font face="Verdana">If youre looking to get more organized this year, youre not alone. And you dont have to go it alone, either.&#0160; There are a number of resources, classes, and books available to help you get organized. Find a resource that works for you and will help you achieve your resolution this year. In the next couple of posts, Ill be sharing resources that can help you get organized. I&#39;ll start by sharing&#0160;info on the on-line workshops Im participating in this month that will help you keep your resolution to get organized. </font></span></p>

This workshop started the day after Christmas and stays open through January 16th. If youre still surrounded by holiday clutter like new gifts that still need a home or&#0160;holiday decor, Clear&#0160;Out the Holiday Clutter was designed with you in mind.&#0160;You&#39;ll get ideas for all your holiday organizing needs, including ideas for storing all your holiday items---from garland to greeting cards. At just $16 its a low cost way to try out on-line organizing workshops.</font></span></p>

 	                 	                        <h3 class="entry-header"><a href="http://creativeorganizing.typepad.com/creative_organizing/2008/12/one-little-word-for-2009.html">one little word for 2009</a></h3>
 	                
 	                <div class="entry-content">
 	                        <div class="entry-body">
 	                                <p>I&#39;ve decided once again to join&#0160;<a href="http://aliedwards.typepad.com/_a_/2008/12/one-little-wo-1.html">Ali&#39;s&#0160;one little word project</a> again for 2009. I seriously love the simplicity of this idea. Selecting one word as a point&#0160;of focus for the year ahead. I truly love this. </p>
<p>My word for 2009 is now. </p>
<p>Notice it&#39;s not &quot;NOW&quot; or &quot;now!&quot; but just plain now...in all lowercase letters. It&#39;s now spoken in a whisper as opposed to being yelled by a boisterous two-year old saying &quot;I want dinner NOW!&quot;</p>
<p>So why now? (I love the double meaning of that, by the way.) </p>
<p>Well, now because life is &quot;now.&quot; Now is all we have. Our life is just one continual unfolding of&#0160;nows...nows that turn into &quot;thens&quot; in just the blink of an eye. Life is all about the decisions we make right now. </p>
<p>Right now I can&#0160;choose to be happy.</p>
<p>Right now I can&#0160;choose to take care of a task so that it doesn&#39;t linger on my psyche for many more nows to come. </p>
<p>Right now I can choose to take the first step on my next big dream or goal.</p>
<p>Right now&#0160;I can choose to love and listen and really pay attention to the people I care about in my life. </p>
<p>Right now I can choose to snuggle with my son...because who knows how much longer snuggling with Mom will be acceptable in his world.</p>
<p>And that last one is the reason for my word. One night earlier this month I snuggled with Collin before bed, part of our nightly ritual. I was getting up to leave...or maybe I had already left and he called me back in. Could I snuggle for a little bit longer?</p>
<p>Now, I had close to a million things left on my to-do list for the day...but I knew my chance to snuggle a little bit longer was right then. It was now in the context of that evening.&#0160;This chance to snuggle just a bit longer might not be there tomorrow, or the next day, or the next. In ten years of snuggling with this boy, it&#39;s been very rare that he has asked for just a bit longer. The moment was now. </p>
<p>I keep hearing that John Mellencamp song in my mind...(or perhaps he was John Cougar at the time, or maybe he was in the transition stage of John Cougar Mellencampbut either way you know who I&#39;m talking about.)&#0160;The chorus to the song is &quot;your life is now.&quot; Yes it is. And I will remind myself of that for the entire year to come. </p>
<p><a href="http://creativeorganizing.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c3c0f53ef010536a863f6970c-pi" style="DISPLAY: inline"><img alt="IMG_5925" class="at-xid-6a00d8341c3c0f53ef010536a863f6970c " src="http://creativeorganizing.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c3c0f53ef010536a863f6970c-320wi" /></a> </p>
<p>My life is now...not tomorrow, not yesterday. But now. And it always will be.</p>
<p>Here&#39;s to a joyful 2009! I wish you and yours the very best both tonight and throughout the year. And if you&#39;re participating in the one little word project...post a link or comment about your word. I&#39;d love to know your point of focus for 2009.</p>

<p>This year I used things I already had on hand. Just bought one new roll...the &quot;Santa wrap&quot; shown above. This is the never-before-seen wrap that is used for Santa&#39;s gifts. This year Santa wants the kids to open gifts in a certain order...from least exciting to most exciting. So I created number tags and initial tags, both of which can be reused next year, as can the ribbon. Thinking a bit more about the environment these days.</p>

<p>I made that tag years ago...fun to recycle them year after year. I just wanted to share some last-minute gift wrapping ideas. </p>
<p>If you celebrate Christmas, I hope you and yours have a truly magical day! </p>

<li>
<p>Putting the finishing touches on Christmas preparations...running a few final errands and&#0160;getting ready to wrap (my favorite part.)</p></li>
<li>
<p>Grandma Suzi, my Mom, is en-route via train from Michigan. (Hooray!)</p></li>

<ul>
<li>Enjoying my newest adventure in crafting...knitting. Finally taught myself how to do this, thanks to giving Kailea <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1570548617?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=simp101inc-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=1570548617">this book</a><img alt="" border="0" height="1" src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=simp101inc-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=1570548617" style="BORDER-RIGHT: medium none; BORDER-TOP: medium none; MARGIN: 0px; BORDER-LEFT: medium none; BORDER-BOTTOM: medium none" width="1" />&#0160;for her birthday. This is such a fun thing to do with my girl...I&#39;m loving it. </li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Enjoying quiet time with my family, watching Christmas specials,&#0160;football and Food TV, with a fire crackling in the fireplace. </li>
</ul>
<p>I love this place where we are right now...just a few days before Christmas, relaxing, and just enjoying the anticipation. </p>
<p>I hope you&#39;re having a wonderful weekend, too. Are you ready for the big holiday? How are you spending your time in these final days before the holidays? </p>

I put that term in quotes because really, if the grass is still showing through the snow, is it snowy enough to call off school? Apparently it is here in Southern Illinois. This just isn&#39;t Michigan. Completely different snow&#0160;day standards around&#0160;these parts. ;)</p>
<p>So I&#39;m going to go enjoy the quiet and get some things done before bed. Here&#39;s wishing you quiet if you need quiet...and if you need noise...well, feel free to stop by my house tomorrow...it may snow flurry tonight and my kids will probably be home again...&#0160;:) </p>

<p>The winner of <a href="http://www.simplify101.com/learn-how-to-get-organized.php">Organizing 101</a> is&#0160;Kari S. from Texas! </p>
<p>The winner of the <a href="http://shop.simplify101.com/how-to-achieve-your-goals-p/s101ws0009.htm">goals online workshop</a> is Susan B. who is also from Texas! </p>
<p>And the grand prize winner of the <a href="http://www.epson.com/cgi-bin/Store/consumer/consDetail.jsp?BV_UseBVCookie=yes&amp;oid=63073901">Epson&#0160;Stylus Photo R1900</a>&#0160;is Vanessa P.&#0160;from Georgia!</p>
<p>If you aren&#39;t sure if you&#39;re Kari S., Susan B., or Vanessa P., go check you email in-box. If you are one of these three lucky ladies, you&#39;ll have a happy email from me letting you know you won. ;)</p>
<p>Thanks so much to everyone who took the time to complete the survey and join in all this fun! If you had your heart set on the printer...it looks like Epson has $150 in rebates and free shipping going on right now. I realize this is not quite as good as free...but it&#39;s still a great deal on a mighty fine printing machine.&#0160; </p>
<p>If you were one of the people who&#0160;mentioned in your survey comments that the workshops are on your wish list...you can help that wish along by letting&#0160;Santa know about <a href="http://shop.simplify101.com/category-s/45.htm">simplify 101 gift certificates</a>.&#0160;Sometimes Santa needs a nudge, you know. :)</p>

<p>By the way, if you&#0160;are the winner and you live in the United States, we will ship your printer to you via ground service. If you are outside of the United States, we will contact&#0160;you about shipping the printer to your location and the cost associated to do so. Also, we may not be able to ship the printer to you out of the country due&#0160;to restrictions and regulations on shipping electronics...but we&#39;ll cross that bridge if and when we get to it! </p>
<p>To enter, simply fill out a brief survey.<span style="COLOR: #c00000; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">**Survey is now closed.**</span>&#0160;The survey is designed to help me help you. What topics are you interested in hearing me blog&#0160;about? What types of workshops are you interested in...or are you interested in workshops at all? It&#39;s short. It&#39;s sweet. And the payoff...well that could be&#0160;pretty sweet, too! Deadline to enter is Tuesday, December 16th at 9:00 PM Central. To enter, you simply fill out the survey, including your first name and email&#0160;address.

<p>And I&#39;m having fun with my little gratitude project, too.</p>
<p>Here&#39;s yesterday&#39;s photo...</p>
<p><a href="http://creativeorganizing.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c3c0f53ef010536485516970c-pi" style="DISPLAY: inline"><img alt="IMG_5313" class="at-xid-6a00d8341c3c0f53ef010536485516970c " src="http://creativeorganizing.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c3c0f53ef010536485516970c-500wi" /></a>&#0160; </p>
<p>It&#39;s a mombo IKEA bag (one of those really big blue ones) loaded full of little white pots and the IKEA 2009 catalog. I&#39;m grateful not just for the big, bag full o&#39; pots, but also for my friend <a href="http://www.peaceofmindorganizing.com/blog/">Janine</a>&#0160;who purchased the pots (and wrapped all 30 of them!) on her recent trip to IKEA. Now that&#39;s the sign of a true friend. The photo I wish I had gotten was of Janine lugging this bag from her car to mine...that&#39;s when I realized I might have gone a tad-bit overboard on the pots. (More on the pots later...I have ideas for days on how to use these little cuties to organize stuff. And thank you to Karyl, too, for her help in the pot-wrapping frenzy.)</p>
<p>Here&#39;s Thursday&#39;s photo:</p>
<p><a href="http://creativeorganizing.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c3c0f53ef010536495b77970c-pi" style="DISPLAY: inline"><img alt="IMG_5292" class="at-xid-6a00d8341c3c0f53ef010536495b77970c " src="http://creativeorganizing.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c3c0f53ef010536495b77970c-500wi" /></a>&#0160; </p>
<p>Grateful that: the weekly cleaning and grocery shopping are done. Homework is done and planners are ready to sign. And the receipt in the background is there because I saved $19 on groceries that night (and the total was under $100 before the $19 savings) and this, my friends, makes me happy.Oh and the wine...I was getting ready to go relax with Jay. Ahh...the perfect end to a productive evening.</p>
<p>OK...now to answer a question I had about using the two brag books. Here are a couple more photos:</p>
<p><a href="http://creativeorganizing.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c3c0f53ef010536495d05970c-pi" style="DISPLAY: inline"></a>&#0160;<a href="http://creativeorganizing.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c3c0f53ef010536412e15970b-pi" style="DISPLAY: inline"><img alt="IMG_5303" class="at-xid-6a00d8341c3c0f53ef010536412e15970b " src="http://creativeorganizing.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c3c0f53ef010536412e15970b-500wi" /></a> </p>
<p>This shows where the tape is. See how invisible it is? You can&#39;t even see it. But, what you can see is that I just stacked the two books on top of each other (after removing the front of one and the back of the other. Then, with the two books sandwiched together, I just taped along the spine. </p>
<p>Here is one more photo. Once the books are taped together, I ran ribbon from the inside around the outside, to cover the (already invisible) tape. :)</p>
<p><a href="http://creativeorganizing.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c3c0f53ef010536495d96970c-pi" style="DISPLAY: inline"><img alt="IMG_5306" class="at-xid-6a00d8341c3c0f53ef010536495d96970c " src="http://creativeorganizing.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c3c0f53ef010536495d96970c-120wi" /></a>&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; </p>
<p>Let me know if there are any other questions...and thanks for inspiring me with your gratitude comments for Freebie Friday. I&#39;ve gotten (as my Dad would say) chilly bumps reading them. :) Now that&#39;s good stuff. </p>
<p>Have a happy Saturday. We&#39;re going to cut down our tree today...and there&#39;s a bit of snow on the ground. I&#39;m grateful already.</p>

<p>Want to win? Just post a comment sharing what you&#39;re grateful for this holiday season. I&#39;ll close comments Sunday, December 7th at 9:00 PM Central. The winner will be announced Monday evening.</p>
<p>Good luck!!</p>

 	                                <p>I realize many of you come here looking for organizing tips...and sometimes&#0160;I like to blog about other topics such as scrapbooking and other fun stuff that&#39;s on my mind. Well, if you&#39;d like to be sure to get a little tidbit of organizing each and every week, I have good news! You can sign up for my weekly organizing quick tip.&#0160;If you aren&#39;t receiving it yet...here&#39;s the scoop. It&#39;s similar to my monthly organizing email newsletter only weekly(er) and shorter content. It&#39;s a quick read and I try to stay focused on organizing, getting things done, and stuff like that. </p>
<p>Here&#39;s a little taste test of today&#39;s quick tip:</p>
<p><strong>Say Yes First</strong></p>
<p>Were in the throes of the holiday seasonthe busiest time of the year. (I hope youre having a good time, by the way!) </p>
<p>Heres something to keep in mind this holiday season:&#0160; how you choose to spend your time will determine how joyful this time of year is for you. What will you say yes to? And what will become a noeither by choice or by default because you simply ran out of time?</p>
<p>Practical time management wisdom suggests that we must say no to keep control of our schedule. Frankly, I dont know anyone who doesnt have more options as to how to spend their time than time available to spend. We all must say no at some point in time. The question is this:&#0160; are we saying no to the right things?</p>
<p>What if we switched it around just a bit, and instead of saying no we say yes first?</p>
<p>Heres what I mean. To make the most of this holiday season, say yes to those activities you *want* to spend your time on. Choose your yeses based on what will make you and your loved ones happiest throughout the season. Then, carve out specific times on your calendar for all your yeses. If other events or to-dos arise throughout the season, you can work them in around your previously decided yeses or you can say no to them with confidence. </p>
<p>By saying yes first, youll know your holiday time will be spent on the activities you and your loved ones value most. </p>
