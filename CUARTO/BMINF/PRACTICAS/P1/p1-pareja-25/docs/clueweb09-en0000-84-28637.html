Mitchell Scholarship, along with Truman Scholarship">UAs Adam Harbison wins George J. Mitchell Scholarship, along with Truman Scholarship</a></h2>
<span class="timestamp">12:33 pm, December 9th, 2008</span>
<div class="entry"><p>Chalk up another prestigious scholarship for The University of Alabamas Adam Harbison.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in">	Harbison, a December 07 UA graduate (summa cum laude) from Crane Hill who majored in health care management (4.0 GPA), has won one of 12 George J. Mitchell Scholarships offered for study in Ireland and Northern Ireland. Harbison last year was named the only Truman Scholar from Alabama, and one of only 65 nationally.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in">	The George J. Mitchell Scholarship is a national competitive fellowship sponsored by the U.S.-Ireland Alliance. The Mitchell Scholarship, named to honor the former U.S. Senators pivotal contribution to the Northern Ireland peace process, is designed to introduce and connect generations of future American leaders to the island of Ireland, while recognizing and fostering intellectual achievement, leadership, and a commitment to public service and community.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in">	Twelve Mitchell Scholars between the ages of 18 and 30 are chosen annually for one year of postgraduate study in any discipline offered by institutions of higher learning in Ireland and Northern Ireland. Applicants are judged on three criteria: academic excellence, leadership, and a sustained commitment to service and community. The Mitchell Scholarship provides tuition, housing, a living expenses stipend, and an international travel stipend.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in"> The Mitchell Scholars were selected after a rigorous application process that drew 300 applications from more than 150 colleges and universities across the country. The process culminated in a final interview before a selection committee composed of eminent leaders from many fields.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in">	Harbison, UAs first Mitchell Scholar, will leave for the Emerald Isle in September, 09, and will spend a year working in the countrys rural areas while studying at Queens University Belfast.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in">	I am really excited about this opportunity, Harbison said. Ireland is really progressive in this area. The country does a lot for its rural communities. They look across borders and look at everything holistically. I am truly looking forward to learning about how to address the economic, social and environmental factors that affect rural areas and citizens.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in">	Harbison is a Truman-Albright Fellow working in Washington, D.C. with the Appalachian Regional Commission, a federal-state partnership that works with the people of Appalachia to promote economic and social development, develop infrastructure and manage health care projects.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in">	One of Harbisons passions is addressing the health needs of the rural poor, and one of his responsibilities with the ARC involves improving oral health in West Virginia. Harbison initiated a $500,000 oral health care program for the rural poor that provides preventative dental care in schools and links the children to area dentists. The US  Ireland Alliance noted Harbisons work in West Virginia in announcing his selection.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in">	Health care runs in the Harbison family. His mother is a nurse. Health care is something I have always been around and I thought about going into the medical field, but I decided that I could have the biggest impact on the administrative and policy side, he said.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in">	While an undergraduate at UA, Harbison served as founder and president of UAs College Against Cancer chapter and created the Tobacco Kit, a tool designed to assist campuses in the adoption and enforcement of smoke-free policies. In 2006-07, he was appointed and served as National Advocacy Chair for the organization, overseeing the work of more than 350 chapters.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in">	Harbison served as an intern with Alabama State Treasurer Kay Ivey in 2005 and got a taste of public service, including acting as liaison to the Alabama Black Belt Action Commission health committee.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in">  	He was a member of the Advanced Business Honors Program and a member of Beta Gamma Sigma Business Honorary. At the 2007 Honors Day, he was tapped into all four senior honoraries including the Anderson Society, Mortar Board, Blue Key and ODK. He received the UA National Alumni Associations Outstanding Senior Award and was named to the USA Today All-USA Today College Academic Team.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in"> He said the education he has received at The University of Alabama and at the Culverhouse College of Commerce has been top-notch.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in">	The University and the College has prepared me not only academically, but for real life situations, he said. He said Dr. Marilyn Whitman, director of the business schools health care management program, Dr. Robert Halli, dean of the Honors College, and Dr. Ron Dulek, John R. Miller Professor of Management and Marketing, have been particularly helpful.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in">	Harbison said he plans to return to Alabama following his time in Ireland to apply what he has learned in the rural areas of his home state.</p>

<span class="timestamp">9:57 am, December 4th, 2008</span>
<div class="entry"><p>Lekisha Rachel Gunn, a University of Alabama senior from Montgomery who is double-majoring in German and economics, has been selected to be a 2008-2009 DAAD Young Ambassador.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in">	DAAD Young Ambassadors are undergraduate students from North America who have recently studied in Germany and are interested in promoting study in Germany to students at their home school. DAAD Ambassadors help encourage fellow students to study abroad by highlighting their experiences. Ambassador selection is competitive and the students receive training in New York once selected.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in">	Last year, Gunn was a DAAD Undergraduate Scholarship recipient and studied at the University of Mannheim during the 2008 spring semester. Gunn spent five months abroad studying German history and improving her language skills.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in">	Gunn plans to study international law and says she would love to live in Germany again if the opportunity presented itself in the future. Gunn says she encourages all of her fellow students to study in Germany and believes the rewards are indescribable.</p>

<span class="timestamp">9:34 am, December 4th, 2008</span>
<div class="entry"><p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in">	The October 31 issue of <em>Public Accounting Report, </em>the newsletter of the accounting profession, ranks the Culverhouse School of Accountancy at The University of Alabama at No. 15, in the 27<sup>th</sup> Annual Professors Survey, the same position it held in 2007.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in">	The graduate accounting program at UA was ranked 19<sup>th</sup>, a two-place jump from last year.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in">	The newsletter said 1,557 accounting educators participated in the survey, which ranked the University of Texas at Austin No. 1 in undergraduate accounting and Brigham Young University No. 1 in graduate accounting.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in">	Dr. Mary Stone, director of the Culverhouse School of Accountancy, said the rankings are a testament to the faculty and students at the school.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in">	Our faculty members work hard to make sure their classes are relevant and that our students are well schooled in the most critical areas of accounting, Stone said, and our students hard working and determined to learn and succeed.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in">	In the school-ranking section of the Annual Survey of Accounting Professors, accounting professors, department heads and department chairs were asked to name the undergraduate and graduate programs that offer degrees in accounting they feel most consistently turn out students capable of some day attaining partner status.<br />
The survey had its largest voter turnout and the highest professor participation level to date.</p>

<span class="timestamp">9:26 am, December 4th, 2008</span>
<div class="entry"><p style="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in">	The University of Alabama has again been chosen as a McGowan Scholars Academic Institution for the 2009-2010 academic year by the William G. McGowan Charitable Fund Inc.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in">	Armelle Honkou, a student in UAs Culverhouse College of Commerce and Business Administration, was awarded the inaugural William G. McGowan Scholarship for the 2008-2009 academic year.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in">	The William G. McGowan Charitable Fund Inc. was founded in 1992 to promote, nurture and develop the gifts and talents of students. The William G. McGowan Scholars Program was created by the Fund specifically to provide selected colleges and universities with scholarships to help students who wish to pursue a business education.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in">	The program aims to recognize the academic achievements and excellence of business students and is designed to encourage leadership ability, interpersonal skills, and a significant involvement in academic, campus and community activities. It also recognizes excellence of character, a spirit of innovation and entrepreneurial potential.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in">	The recipient of this honor must also be recommended by at least one member of the business school faculty. Honkou was recommended by Dr. Helenka Nolan, a lecturer in the department of management and marketing.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in">	She was the main reason I got that scholarship, and I am very grateful, Honkou said.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in">	Selection is based on scholarship, character, community involvement, talent and leadership qualities.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in">	Honkou, originally from Togo, West Africa, moved to the United States in March 2000. She lived in Mobile before enrolling at The University of Alabama. She is pursuing a degree in finance with a minor in French and is now studying in Paris.
