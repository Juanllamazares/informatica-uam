      <p>Homeschooling can challenge the scheduling skills of even the most
        organized moms. How can you
        keep different ages and abilities scheduled with academic work, field
        trips, extracurricular activities, and the usual other appointments that
        life requires? The best way is by having a vision that it can be done
        and by working with your own personality. If you are a person who abhors
        schedules, don't try to implement something that will detail your life
        down to five minute intervals. If you cannot stand to do without your
        schedules and lists, then a PDA is more likely to suit you than winging it. </p>

      <h4>Motivation</h4>
      <p>To start, you must be motivated. If you are overwhelmed, take a few
        moments to do some reading and let yourself rediscover the notion that
        it is possible to feel more in control of your life and your schedule.
        Maybe you have your homeschool under control but your house is beginning
        to take on a life of its own. Or maybe you are the opposite and your
        house is spotless but you can't seem to get on top of the lesson plans
        for your school. Wherever you find yourself, browse through these articles
        and websites, letting them inspire you and motivate you to take a step
        forward in taking back control.</p>
