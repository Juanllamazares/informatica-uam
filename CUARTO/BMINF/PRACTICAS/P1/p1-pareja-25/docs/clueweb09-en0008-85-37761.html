<P><I>By Francine Silverman </I></P>

<P>The glory days of Indiana's two grandest resorts are definitely gone.
When it opened in 1902, <B><A HREF="http://www.cookgroup.com/historic_landmarks/">West
Baden Springs Hotel</A></B> was dubbed the Eighth Wonder of the World.
Closed as a hotel in 1932 and unoccupied since 1983, the crumbling structure
is undergoing a massive restoration, its fate unknown. <IMG SRC="wb1.gif" HEIGHT=164 WIDTH=260 ALIGN=RIGHT></P>

<P>Tourists standing in the Pompeian Court under the massive glass-and-steel
dome must think they're in a Greek ruin. &quot;This is probably Indiana's
number one architectural landmark and it's going to be saved,&quot; declared
my tour guide, Kent Abraham. </P>

<P>That remains to be seen. The owner, Historic Landmarks Foundation, is
seeking a new user for the property. Cook Group, a Bloomington, Indiana-based
medical technology company, is spending about $14 million to renovate a
third of the facility. This is less than half of the estimated $40 million
needed to restore the hotel and its 708 rooms to prime condition. </P>

<P>It's anyone's guess why <B><A HREF="http://www.4x4now.com/ajjflr.htm">French
Lick Springs Resort</A></B>, a mile away, survived the Depression and its
chief rival did not. </P>

<P><IMG SRC="frlick.jpg" HEIGHT=130 WIDTH=210 ALIGN=LEFT>After all, these
two fashionable spas had much in common. Both had mineral springs, believed
to cure everything from cancer to alcoholism to constipation. French Lick's
&quot;Pluto&quot; water was bottled nationally as &quot;America's Laxative,&quot;
inspiring its motto, &quot;When Nature Won't, Pluto Will.&quot; </P>

<P>These cold springs were mostly used for drinking - popularly called
&quot;dipping and sipping,&quot; although in 1920 a &quot;Pluto Bath&quot;
was advertised, at 50 cents. Of the seven springs in the area, all but
one were eventually capped over. The survivor is at French Lick, bubbling
under a gazebo behind the hotel and smelling as foul as a hot spring. Paula
Mills, the activities director, recalls: &quot;As a child my father played
in an orchestra here. I can remember Proserpine (spring), which was probably
capped and covered with a brick patio sometime in the 1960s.&quot; She
also recounts that &quot;Paul Harvey used to spend a lot of time at French
Lick&quot; and that he discovered the mineral water contains lithium. This
led to his &quot;Rest of the Story,&quot; suggesting that health seekers
were drugged into thinking they were cured. </P>

<P>Between 1887 and the 1950s, trains provided direct service to French
Lick, at one point stopping there 14 times a day. Wealthy guests would
spend their winters in Miami, summers in Mackinac Island in Michigan and
the fall season at French Lick. They'd come to take the cure, some folks
ingesting as many as 20 glasses a day. The laxative effect spawned several
outhouses along the promenade, later replaced by the tennis courts. (Today's
guests can bathe in the 22-mineral Pluto water in the health and fitness
spa). </P>

<P>Both French Lick and West Baden were meccas for the gilded class - celebrities
and mobsters alike. Between 1900 and World War I, it was common to see
more than 100 private autos and Pullman cars parked on the sidings at both
hotels. Photos in the basement at French Lick show Lana Turner signing
an autograph on the front steps; Bing Crosby teeing up on the Hill course;
George Jessel in the lobby; and Franklin D. Roosevelt in the ballroom accepting
the presidential nomination in 1932. French Lick was also the spring training
headquarters of the Chicago Cubs from 1879 to 1930. Between the 1920s and
1940s, the town boasted 12 gambling casinos and 20 hotels within a mile
radius. Legend has it that Capone would arrive in a bulletproof car and
gamble all night. He probably stayed at West Baden since he was refused
entry at French Lick. &quot;Anybody who was anybody was at French Lick
at one time or another,&quot; says G. Alan Barnett, president of the Indiana
Railway Museum for 35 years and conductor of the French Lick, West Baden
Railroad. &quot;This area never came back after the Depression.The hotel
didn't close but the clientele would change dramatically.&quot; </P>

<P>Sadly, the basement memorabilia contains the only early history of French
Lick. Tom Taggart Jr., who took over in 1929 after his father died, and
sold in 1946, destroyed all the records from almost half a century. &quot;I
think for him the operation of the hotel became a real burden,&quot; says
Mills. Despite his devotion to his employees, it was such a relief, she
guesses. &quot;Most of what we have is from a 1952 thesis by Richard Haupt
at Indiana University.&quot; </P>

<P>We do know that the name French Lick originated in the 1700s when French
fur traders observed livestock licking the mineral deposits found at the
springs. Later on, American settlers built a fort in this &quot;Valley
of the Seven Springs.&quot; In 1845, physician William Bowles purchased
the site and three mineral springs from the state of Indiana for $1.25
an acre. Eight years later, he opened the hotel and began selling &quot;Pluto&quot;
water across the nation. (Two statues of these mythical gods of the lower
world once guarded the springs from atop the old hotel entrance, but are
now indoors). </P>

<P>The first French Lick hotel, a three-story frame structure, was destroyed
by fire in 1897. In 1901, Tom J. Taggart, the former mayor of Indianapolis
and Democratic boss, purchased the site. The West Baden Hotel had just
burned to the ground and he didn't want to lose potential spa business.
The present hotel, on 2600 acres, is an expanded and renovated version
of Taggart's hotel. </P>

<P>Says Mills: &quot;During the Taggart years, the furnishings were replaced
quite frequently. Taggart always had a very modern hotel.&quot; The kitchen
was self-sustaining, providing its own home-grown vegetables and milk products.
A 1929 Christmas menu features barbequed opossum with southern candied
yams and ice cream. (Tomato juice was first served and bottled in French
Lick in 1917. A smokestack is all that's left of the factory). </P>

<P>Taggart's plan to create &quot;the grandest hotel in the midwest&quot;
included a world class golf course, at a time when the sport was relatively
new in the U.S. In 1907, he hired Scotsman Thomas Bendelow to build the
18-hole Valley Golf Link course. Six years later, he hired another Scotsman,
Donald Ross, to design the championship Hill course two miles south of
French Lick. Flat and treeless, the Valley course is used by the recreational
golfer; the Hill course, set among rolling fairways and highbanked bunkers,
is more challenging and professional. (Larry Bird, the town's favorite
native son, plays there on a regular basis). &quot;We are the only full
spa, golf and tennis resort and convention hotel in the midwest,&quot;
boasts Michael Pitstick of Boykin Lodging Company, owners of the hotel
since April 1997. &quot;Golf is our strongest attraction.&quot; </P>

<P>It's Barnett's opinion that French Lick survived because it was Democratic
and had lower rates, whereas West Baden attracted Republicans. &quot;Many
of those people's wealth was on paper,&quot; he says. &quot;Ed (Ballard)
closed it in the Depression. His business came to a screeching halt. Taggart
managed to have the wherewithal to hold the thing together.&quot; </P>

<P>Between 1954 and 1979, the property had several owners, including the
Sheraton Hotel chain. In attempting to modernize it, they covered the front
windows with wood, thereby blocking out sunlight, painted the brass white
and hid the tile floors in the lobby under a carpet. &quot;I can remember
as a child marble being taken to the local dump,&quot; Mills says with
a shudder. </P>

<P>Fortunately, in recent years the owners have taken an interest in enhancing
the nearly century-old hotel. In the next ten years, Boykin plans to spend
$20 million to improve the landscape and pool area. It also plans to re-route
traffic and increase maintenance and food/beverage personnel by 25 percent
each. The Luther James Family of Louisville, which assumed ownership in
1981, spent $7 million for renovations. &quot;Luther James had three different
decorators until he could finally find one,&quot; Mills recalls. &quot;They
remodeled a floor at a time. Most of the guests weren't even aware they
were remodeling. </P>

<P>&quot;The James family had planned to own it indefinitely,&quot; she
adds, until it got an offer it couldn't refuse. &quot;I thought they were
going to be our Taggarts. Apparently Boykin made them three different offers,
raising the price each time.&quot; </P>

<P>French Lick and its environs may not have the grandeur of old, but still
holds a special place in the hearts of some. Barnett says he &quot;fell
in love&quot; with the hotel years ago. Larry Bird, who has a home in town,
&quot;grew up with a lot of the people who work in our resort&quot; and
has his hair cut in the neighborhood, says Pitstick. When Bird was an NBA
All-Star, a reporter asked how it felt to be home in Indianapolis. &quot;I
ain't from here,&quot; Bird replied in disbelief. &quot;I'm from French
Lick.&quot; </P>

<P>-------------</P>

<P>French Lick is the largest, most complete four-season resort in the
Midwest. It has 485 guest rooms,15 meeting and function rooms and nine
restaurants and lounges. Sports facilities include two 18-hole golf courses,
eight indoor and ten outdoor tennis courts, complete health spa, horseback
riding, bowling, bicycling, shuffleboard and horseshoes. There are planned
social activities and live entertainment.</P>
