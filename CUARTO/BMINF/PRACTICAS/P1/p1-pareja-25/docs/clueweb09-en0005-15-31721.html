<p>The popular &#8220;Getting Things Done&#8221; <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Getting_Things_Done">principle</a> is a valuable tool for organizing, prioritizing and actively completing all of the tasks and responsibilities that weigh us down each day. Invented by David Allen, this &#8220;groundbreaking work-life management system&#8221; <a href="http://www.davidco.com/what_is_gtd.php">relies</a> on four methods of clearing the brain of endless to-do lists so that it can focus more effectively on the job at hand. These methods are: &#8220;capturing anything and everything that has your attention, defining actionable things discretely into outcomes and concrete next steps, organizing reminders and information in the most streamlined way&#8221; and &#8220;keeping current and &#8220;on your game&#8221; with appropriately frequent reviews&#8230;of your commitments,&#8221; according to the David Allen website.</p>

	<p>I am attempting in 2008 to have a paperless GTD system by combining vitalist.com (which I have been using for a year and  is the best 2.0 online GTD app I feel) with my new Fujitsu S510 scanner. So far it is working great. (Pics and a complete review are at <a href="http://www.worshiptrench.com/?p=231" rel="nofollow">http://www.worshiptrench.com/?p=231</a>).  I didn&#8217;t think it was going to be possible, but I really am 95% paperless and there are no stacks anywhere on my desk.</p>
