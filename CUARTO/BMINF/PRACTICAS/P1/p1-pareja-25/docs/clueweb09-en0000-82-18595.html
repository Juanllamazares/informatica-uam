				<p><strong><img border="0" src="http://blog.rubbermaid.com/photos/uncategorized/2009/01/07/ilene_drexler.jpg" title="Ilene_drexler" alt="Ilene_drexler" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; float: right;" />
Ilene Drexler, CPO - New York, NY - <a target="_blank" href="http://www.OrganizingWiz.com">www.OrganizingWiz.com</a></strong></p>

<p><strong>1. How long have you been a professional organizer?</strong><br />I've been a professional organizer for 4.5 years.</p>

<p><strong>2. What inspired you to become a professional organizer?</strong><br />My lifelong passion for organizing .&nbsp; I had spent 20 years in corporate operations working on efficiency and process improvement in supply chain management, but was tired of the corporate world.&nbsp; It's so much more rewarding seeing results quickly in a one-on-one with clients, vs. waiting months for corporate project teams to produce results.&nbsp; &nbsp;I love the fact that I can transform an area for a client in 2-4 hours. </p>

<p><strong>3. What is the most common organizing project youre hired to do?</strong><br />Filing systems/home office organizing is #1, with closet organizing being a close second.&nbsp; These two areas represent about 70-80% of my business.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>4. What is the most common organizing challenge people have?</strong><br />Getting rid of the unneeded/unloved &quot;stuff&quot;.&nbsp; So may clients get stuck in clutter because for whatever the reason, they have not gotten rid of the things that are just in their way.&nbsp; Working with a Professional Organizer can help them to make decisions about letting go.&nbsp; &nbsp;Most feel much &quot;lighter&quot; afterwards (their words).&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>5. If you had to pick your biggest organizing challenge, what would it be?</strong><br />There is never enough time to do all the things I want to with my business for longer term projects like working on my web site content, writing articles, etc.&nbsp; I'm pretty organized, but as a solopreneur, client work &amp; development take most of my time.&nbsp; Having a staff is the only thing I miss about working in the corporate world.<br /><strong><br />6. What one tip would you give to people who are trying to get organized?</strong><br />If you want a different result, you have to be willing to change your habits regardless of the organizing system implemented; it's hard work.&nbsp; It's been shown to take 21 days of doing the new behavior to create a new habit.&nbsp; An organizer can create the best system in the world for you, but if you are not willing to do things differently, you won't accomplish long term change.</p>

<p><strong>7. The # 1 question I get is how long do I need to keep this piece of paper?</strong><br />The answer of course varies based on the type of record. <br /> </p>

<p><strong>8. How can potential clients get in touch with you?</strong>&nbsp; <br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Ilene Drexler<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Certified Professional Organizer �<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; The Organizing Wiz �<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 201 East 87th Street #11G<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; New York, NY 10128<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Phone: 917-301-1981<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Fax: 212-828-3663<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Email: ilene@organizingwiz.com<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Web Site: <a target="_blank" href="http://www.organizingwiz.com">www.organizingwiz.com</a><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Twitter: <a target="_blank" href="http://twitter.com/OrganizingWiz">http://twitter.com/OrganizingWiz</a> </p>

Krista Colvin, Organize in Style - Professional Organizer + Lifestyle Expert - Camas, Washington - <a href="http://www.TheShebang.com" target="_blank">www.TheShebang.com</a>&nbsp; </strong></p>

<p><strong><br /></strong></p>

<p><strong>1. How long have you been a professional organizer? </strong><br />4 years</p>

<p><strong>2. What inspired you to become a professional organizer?</strong><br />As a new mother on an extended leave of absence from my high school teaching position, I found myself watching a LOT of the Home + Garden channel! It was there I discovered that people actually help others get organized and do it as a business! I was so excited to learn that I could combine my teaching skills with my organizing traits& and work around my mom schedule. </p>

<p><strong>3. What is the most common organizing project youre hired to do?</strong><br />Hands down&overall consultations! Many of my clients are organized woman that are in some type of transition that has messed with their organized lifestyle. They are looking for ideas and solutions to create functional spaces.</p>

<p><strong>4. What is the most common organizing challenge people have?</strong><br />Paper is always a challenge.</p>

<p><strong>5. If you had to pick your biggest organizing challenge, what would it be?</strong><br />Im a piler. I love to have my little piles around me on a big ol desk.</p>

<p><strong>6. What one tips would you give to people who are trying to get organized?</strong><br />Start on a small and emotionally low risk project. Then work your way up to more emotionally charged areas. A kitchen pantry is a great example. Its simple to sort, purge and put back together. The emotional risk is low because no one is attached to expired food.&nbsp; Your clothes closet and childhood keepsakes& well those are filled with emotions and are best dealt with after tackling a project or two!</p>

<strong>Julie Bestry, CPO�  Chattanooga, TN  <a href="http://www.juliebestry.com">www.juliebestry.com</a></strong></p>

<p><strong>1.&nbsp; How long have you been a professional organizer?</strong><br />I started Best Results Organizing in January 2002, about 7 years ago. However, I began consulting with small southeastern television stations on operational issues, including organizing, in the late 1990's.</p>

<p><strong>2. What inspired you to become a&nbsp; professional organizer?</strong><br />Although I'd been organizing others since the age of four (when I wouldn't join in games until I sorted the toys in my neighbor's playroom), I wasn't inspired to start Best Results Organizing until I'd neared the end of a long career as a television program director.&nbsp; Broadcasting is a high-paced environment in which strong organizational skills and systems are paramount for keeping things running smoothly - a little bit of disorganization can lead to dead air, disappointed viewers and lost revenue.</p>

<p>As clich�d as it sounds, September 11th, 2001 was the catalyst for starting my company.&nbsp; Like so many of my colleagues at other television stations and in broadcast syndication, the 9/11 made me really examine my path and determine that life is too short to settle.&nbsp; I craved a professional opportunity that allowed me to use my skills to inspire change and help people achieve their dreams--in an environment where my goofy sense of humor wouldn't be to anyone's disadvantage.</p>

<p>I'd had no idea that professional organizing existed until I read an entry about the National Association of Professional Organizers in the book &quot;Cool Careers for Dummies&quot; and then attended a NAPO-Georgia chapter meeting in Atlanta.&nbsp; I was struck with the realization that the consulting work I'd been doing for years, combined with my habit of idly decluttering friends' homes and offices without realizing it, was actually a recognized profession.&nbsp; It was like finding out George Clooney had secretly been in love with me for decades!&nbsp; By the end of 2001, I'd &quot;retired&quot; from television and started Best Results Organizing, and I've never looked back.</p>

<p><strong>3. What is the most common organizing project you're hired to do?</strong><br />Home office and small business clients contact me to help them gain control over the tsunamis of paper clutter and create better plans for work flow and time management.</p>

<p>Most residential clients contact me because they are &quot;overwhelmed&quot; and don't know where to start to overhaul their generally cluttered lives.&nbsp; This usually involves decluttering and building new systems for the whole house, from kitchen to closets to bedroom and laundry rooms.</p>

<p><strong>4. What is the most common organizing challenge people have?</strong><br />Failing to adapt to life's changes. Disorganization comes from a mismatch between the skills and systems people are using and the actual current demands that life and work place on them.&nbsp; People keep trying to do the same quick fixes, even when life speeds up and demands become more pressing (a la Lucy and Ethel in the chocolate factory).&nbsp; When people find that their old solutions no longer work, their clutter and dissatisfaction grow in tandem until they become paralyzed.&nbsp; They need to recognize that systems and skills much change and adapt and demands change.</p>

<p><strong>5. If you had to pick 'your' biggest organizing challenge, what would it be?</strong><br />I'm pretty set with organizing tangible items, but in terms of time management, my biggest challenge is perfectionist procrastination.&nbsp; I love to write--I write weekly blog posts and articles, and am concurrently writing two books to add to my ebooks that I sell on my website (&quot;Tickle Yourself Organized&quot; and &quot;Simplify the Season &amp; Save Your Sanity&quot;).&nbsp; But it's very hard for me to get myself to start, because I want it to be perfect from the outset.&nbsp; I have to work hard to give myself the same types of advice I give my clients--to just write for five minutes, to brainstorm as if I'm writing a letter to a friend, and to visualize the end-result before starting. </p>

<p><strong>6. What one tips would you give to people who are trying to get organized?</strong><br />Let go of any guilt or embarrassment you feel about what has happened (or NOT happened) in the past.&nbsp; All that matters is today.&nbsp; My company motto is &quot;Don't apologize.&nbsp; Organize.&quot;&nbsp; Just focus on keeping only the items that serve the life you live (or want to live) today, rather than becoming the curator of the Museum of Who You Used To Be.&nbsp; Live for now to make your life happier and easier in the future, too!</p>

<p><strong>7. What secrets do professional organizers know that the general public doesn't?</strong><br />The keys to organizing are the things we've been told all our lives, but professional organizers can help you find new ways to look at things and achieve clarity.&nbsp; For example, your grandma was right about &quot;A place for everything and everything in its place&quot;, but there's more to it.</p>

<p>I tell my clients pretty much the same thing--everything should have a HOME, but NOT EVERYTHING HAS TO LIVE WITH YOU.&nbsp; If something isn't age-appropriate, size-appropriate and life-style appropriate, you're probably already not using it or wearing it.&nbsp; People tend to hold on to clutter because they fear they might need it again someday, whether it's an ugly, itchy sweater or an out-of-date reference book.</p>

<p>Chances are, you operate your life according to the Pareto Rule, or 80/20 Rule, such that most of the time, you're wearing the same 20% of your wardrobe and your kids are playing with the same 20% of their toys. So, letting go of something by giving it to charity, selling it at consignment or auctioning it on eBay works for everyone.&nbsp; You get more space for the life you lead now, the new owners get something they actually want, and your possessions get to lead a useful second life.</p>

<p><strong>8. What's the biggest mistake most people make when trying to get organized?</strong><br />I think the biggest mistake, from at least an economic point of view, is that people go out and buy storage containers FIRST, without assessing their needs, sorting their categories and paring down the clutter.&nbsp; There are FABULOUS products (wink, wink, Rubbermaid!) out there, but before you can assess the styles and sizes of storage tools you need for your kitchen or garage or closets, you need to be a bit ruthless in purging out what you don't need and categorizing what you'll keep.&nbsp; Otherwise, it's like buying an outfit to wear to an unknown event, in an as-yet-undetermined season, when you still have 50 pounds to shed.&nbsp; Sort, organize and *then* select your storage containers.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">
			<div class="entry-body">
				<p><strong><img border="0" alt="Scottroewerprofile" title="Scottroewerprofile" src="http://blog.rubbermaid.com/photos/uncategorized/2008/11/14/scottroewerprofile.jpg" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; float: right;" />
Scott Roewer, CPO  Washington, DC Metro  <a href="http://www.solutionsbyscott.com">www.solutionsbyscott.com</a> or <a href="http://www.declutteryou.com">www.declutteryou.com</a><br /></strong></p>

<p><strong>1. How long have you been a professional organizer?</strong><br />Friends have often joked, that Ive been organizing people since I could say the word container.&nbsp; Although that may be a tad extreme, as a child I was always good at puzzles.&nbsp; I approach each new client like they have a new puzzle for me to solve.&nbsp; The puzzle is disorganization.&nbsp; Solutions by Scott was started in 2003 after I moved to Washington, DC.&nbsp; It was part time venture that turned into a full-time career quickly. Its critical that in these busy times, we find ways to make our lives at home and at the office easier to navigate.</p>

<p><strong>2. What inspired you to become a CPO?</strong><br />There are a few different reasons.&nbsp; First, my goal to earn the CPO� credential was so I could push myself to gather and learn more information that would be helpful while working with clients.&nbsp; Secondly, our marketplace is being flooded with individuals who are starting a business overnight, without any client experience or body of knowledge. Having the CPO� designation has given my clients reassurance that Im the right organizer to hire, and they understand I have the skills and Im serious about the work I do. </p>

<p>Finally, I have found that having professional credentials, particularly the broader-spectrum CPO�, enhanced my standing with clients. Living in Washington, D.C. where it seems everyone has advanced degrees and initials after their name, it was only appropriate that I should, too.&nbsp; As more organizers enter the profession, consumers will continue to ask about certifications and experience.&nbsp; This certification shows my clients that I have the experience, has taken time to become educated on organizing principles, and is committed to the professional organizing industry.&nbsp; </p>

<p><strong>3. What is the most common organizing project youre hired to do?</strong><br />The overall theme with many of my clients organizing projects includes the goal of maximizing their space.&nbsp; This may be in their closet, which requires us to downsize their wardrobe to what they actually wear or possibly redesign their closet based on their needs.&nbsp; This may be about their kitchen so they can use their space wisely and efficiently for cooking.&nbsp; Theres an art to cooking and to an organized kitchen.&nbsp; We often look at space utilization in their home office, where the files are over flowing and their desktop is covered.&nbsp; We need to maximize their space for storage, which often starts with a good purge of the paper and then tweaking their storage to work best for their needs.&nbsp; Others need to maximize their storage space in their garage or basement.&nbsp; We often install storage on walls, which are often under utilized or when clients lack the tools or resources to use their wall space.&nbsp; We install shelving, wall racks, and hooks for our clients all the time.&nbsp; In fact, the <a href="http://www.rubbermaid.com/rubbermaid/garage/index.jhtml">FastTrack� system</a> by Rubbermaid works great in these spaces. </p>

<p><strong>4. What is the most common organizing challenge people have?</strong><br />Remember the philosophy of the paperless office?&nbsp; It didnt happen.&nbsp; The reality is, with the use of technology weve increased the amount of paper we use.&nbsp; We fax, print, copy material we already have in hard copy.&nbsp; With technology, weve dramatically increased our paper consumption.&nbsp; &nbsp;My recommendation is to not print emails or website articles unless its absolutely necessary.&nbsp; Use a tool like <a href="http://www.delicious.com">delicious.com</a> to track online information.&nbsp; If you need to save a copy of it because you think it will disappear, print it as a PDF and save the article on your computer.&nbsp; Use a desktop search tool like <a href="http://www.desktop.google.com">Google Desktop</a>, <a href="http://www.x1.com">X1</a> or Mac users can use <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/300.html#spotlight">Spotlight</a> to find emails and information saved on their computer.&nbsp; If junk mail is the problem, check out this post on ways to stop junk mail: <a href="http://www.declutteryou.com/2008/08/stop-junk-mail-i-dare-you/">http://www.declutteryou.com/2008/08/stop-junk-mail-i-dare-you/</a></p>

<p><strong>5. If you had to pick your biggest organizing challenge, what would it be?</strong><br />Im a visual person, and if I put something away that Im working on, Ill forget about it.&nbsp; You can imagine that leaves a lot of loose paper around.&nbsp; Im sure this sounds familiar to you.&nbsp; Miscellaneous things to do, calls to make, receipts, contacts, things to enter in the calendar, mail  its never ending!&nbsp; &nbsp;Just like everyone else, Ive had to implement tools and systems to help me.&nbsp; For example, I have clear folders on my desk that hold my projects and tasks.&nbsp; Three folders Im usually working with include; enter into computer, call these people, complete and mail.&nbsp; Each folder holds the task associated with the paper.&nbsp; One thing to remember, its the tasks that need organizing, not just the paper.&nbsp; When I come home late in the evening after a meeting, I dont have to shuffle through the phone calls, I can move directly to the enter into computer folder, or the complete and mail tasks.&nbsp; If I am going to have down time while Im out with clients, I can grab my call these people folder and have everything in one spot.&nbsp; This works great for me and for many of my clients whove adopted this same system.</p>

<p><strong>6. What one tip would you give to people who are trying to get organize?</strong><br />There are a few questions we always are asked when someone calls.&nbsp; How long is this going to take is usually one of them.&nbsp; People who are living with chronic clutter need to remember it didnt become this way over night, so its not going to be undone over night.&nbsp; Develop a plan you can live with and make sure it is realistic for you to maintain.&nbsp; Start working in one area, or on one project and finish it before you move on to another space.&nbsp; It may take you a while to finish that area, and thats OK.&nbsp; Start with small intervals of time 10-30 minutes if necessary.&nbsp; I recommend setting a timer so you know when you started and when the end arrives.&nbsp; If you have more time and more energy, set the timer again.&nbsp; If you work using this method, youll be done before you know it! </p>

<p>One more, quick tip for all you paper lovers.&nbsp; If you often print drafts before you print a final copy, one way to keep them from getting mixed up is to print your drafts on a colored or recycled paper.&nbsp; Dont put the white paper or stationary paper in the printer until you know youve created a masterpiece.</p>

<p><strong>7. What is a certified professional organizer� (CPO�)?</strong><br />The CPO� certification is a voluntary effort that recognizes professionals who have met specific minimum standards, and proven through examination and client interaction that they possess the body of knowledge and experience required for certification.&nbsp; The standards, examination and qualifications were developed by the Board of Certification for Professional Organizers, a self-governing organization formed in 2007 to recognize and raise industry standards, practices and ethics through independent certification of professional organizers. </p>

<p>While the CPO� designation is not an endorsement or recommendation, the public can rely on this certification to maximize the value received from the products and services provided by a CPO�.</p>

<p><strong>8. How many CPOs� are there currently? </strong> <br />The inaugural examination was given in April of 2007.&nbsp; Since then over 275 professionals have earned the right to be called a Certified Professional Organizer�.</p>

<p><strong>9. Where do you see organizing as a profession in the future?</strong><br />I think the industry will continue to grow as more people learn about our industry and how we can enhance their life.&nbsp; I think society will learn we do more then what is seen on the dramatic before and after reveals on TV. We truly are a benefit to people and I hope everyone someone day will realize the value of what we do. </p>

<p><strong>10. How can potential clients get in touch with you?</strong><br />

		<div class="entry-content">
			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>In our efforts to help you get organized we've decided to kickoff a regularly occurring series of posts called &quot;Q&amp;A with a Professional Organizer&quot;.&nbsp; Deb Lee from Upper Marlboro, MD has been kind enough to be our first featured organizer. Thanks Deb!</p>

<p><span style="color: #990000;font-size: 1.2em;"><strong>Q&amp;A with a Professional Organizer</strong></span></p>

<p><strong>1. How long have you been a professional organizer?</strong><br />Practically all my life!&nbsp; One of my first organizing jobs (self-imposed) was rearranging the apples in my mums fruit bowl at the age of 9!&nbsp; Then, I moved on to sorting her mail and redesigning her bedroom (yes, my mum was very patient!).&nbsp; After stints as a special needs teacher and regional manager for corporate child care, I officially started my company, D. Allison Lee Professional Organizers, in February 2006.</p>

<p><strong>2. What inspired you to become a CPO?</strong><br />I remember watching a popular television program where a professional organizer assisted a client with reorganizing her bathroom countertops and cabinets.&nbsp; I had a light bulb moment when I realized that I had always helped friends and family to do the same thing with their homes and offices.&nbsp; For quite some time, I had already been relying on several organizing principles in my positions as a teacher and regional manager.&nbsp; I also trained others on how to manage their time better. It seemed like a great fit, so I grabbed the light bulb by the horns, and the rest is history.</p>

<p>Of course, pursuing certification was a very easy decision to make.&nbsp; Certification not only raises the standards of excellence in our field, but also brings more attention to the valuable services that we provide.&nbsp; That, coupled with my membership in the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.napo.net" onClick="javascript: pageTracker._trackPageview("/G1/napot.net");">National Association of Professional Organizers</a> (NAPO) and camaraderie with the other awesome organizers at <a target="_blank" href="http://dcorganizers.org" onClick="javascript: pageTracker._trackPageview("/G1/dcorganizers.org");">NAPO-WDC</a>, continue to inspire me to help others regain balance in their lives.</p>

<p><strong>3. What is the most common organizing project youre hired to do?</strong><br />Many people call me to help them better manage paper.&nbsp; Though we live in a world with vast amounts technology and gadgets to help with almost anything, paper seems to infiltrate our homes, offices, and cars at a rate thats very difficult to keep up with.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>4. What is the most common organizing challenge people have?</strong><br />Many of my clients find it difficult to donate or throw something away.&nbsp; Sometimes, its clothing or something from their childhood.&nbsp; It can be magazines, books, or an item that a loved one has given them. At times, old bills are collected.&nbsp; No matter what the item is, the most common thread among clients seems to be the belief that they will one day have a future need for the things they have kept over the years.</p>

<p><strong>5. If you had to pick your biggest organizing challenge, what would it be?</strong><br />I have so many things I want to do and achieve, sometimes all at once!&nbsp; There really isnt enough time to do it all, so I have to make sure that I keep my calendar and to do list close by to keep myself on track, especially now that Ive started blogging. </p>

<p><strong>6. What one tip would you give to people who are trying to get organized?</strong><br />I actually have two:&nbsp; First, do a little bit every day.&nbsp; Even just 5 minutes a day of organizing activities will go a long way to achieving the desired result.&nbsp; Second, dont print something unless you really must have a paper copy.</p>

<p><strong>7. How can potential clients get in touch with you?</strong><br />I can be reached via the Contact Us page at the <a target="_blank" href="http://dallisonlee.com/index.php?option=com_contact&view=contact&id=1&Itemid=12" onClick="javascript: pageTracker._trackPageview("/G1/dallisonlee.com/contact");">D. Allison Lee website</a>.&nbsp; You can also find me blogging at <a target="_blank" href="http://www.organizetorevitalize.blogspot.com" onClick="javascript: pageTracker._trackPageview("/G1/www.organizetorevitalize.blogspot.com");">Organize to Revitalize</a>!</p>
