"Thanks so very much for all the work you do in your e-mail monthly newsletter. I've been doing family history research for several years, but have learned more in the last year from you than in the last 10 years on my own. I've got a notebook where I keep all my 'helps'. The info from you is right up front. Keep up the good work." (Gayle Navarre)

Here are the 5 steps:</font></h2></center>  <font face="Verdana" size="2"> <p><b>Step 1. Identify what you know about your family:</b>
Write what you already know about your ancestors on a "Pedigree Chart."</p> 
<p>Write the "surname" in all caps: This lets the eye scan genealogical records easier. (RAGAN, Jonathan Daniel)</p> <p>list the dates in this fashion: (03 Mar 1895) Instead of 3/22/1866. This keeps the numbers from getting jumbled.</p> <p>Write the "places" in this order: City/Township, County, State, Country. (Jacksonville, St. Johns, Florida, USA)</p> <p>Also, fill out "Family Groups Records" for at least yourself and your parents.</p> <p>Note: If you are a parent, you will put yourself on a Family Group Record twice.
Once as a child, along with your parents, brothers and sisters. And, once as a
parent with your spouse and children. If there is more than one marriage (yes, fill
out another sheet).</p> <p>These are the MAIN tools used in genealogy research. Filling in the blanks
on these two "charts" are your main objective in researching your genealogy.</p> <p><b>Step 2. Decide what you want to learn:</b>
Pedigree charts ask these questions about each ancestor:</p> <ul>
<li>Born: ???</li>
<p></p><li>Place: ???</li>
<p></p><li>Married: ???</li>
<p></p><li>Place: ???</li>
<p></p><li>Died: ???</li>
<p></p><li>Place: ???</li></ul><p>Pick one of your ancestors from the pedigree chart and identify which
questions you want to answers to about that person, such as, "when and where was he born?"</p> <p><b>Step 3. Select records to search:</b>
There are two main types of genealogical records:</p> <ol>
<li><b>Compiled Records:</b> These are records that have already been researched by others,
such as biographies, family histories, or genealogies that may be on microfilm,
microfiche, in books or on the FamilySearch Web site.</li>
<p></p><li><b>Original Records:</b> Are records that were created at or near the time of an event,
such as birth, marriage, death, or census records.</li></ol>
<p><b>Look for compiled records first, THEN search for original records.</b> This could save
you lots of time and effort. Finding compiled records doesn't mean that there
won't be mistakes or wrong information. But, you might be surprised at what
research may already be done on your family lines.</p> <p><b>Step 4. Obtain and search the record:</b>
Many local libraries have very good genealogical materials. Especially for the
surrounding areas of that library's location. Again, Family History Centers
are an excellent place to obtain records.</p><p>What ever the source, search the records. Look at broad time periods, check
for spelling variations, and write down your results even if you come up empty-handed.</p><p><b>Step 5. Use the information:</b>
Evaluate what you've found. Did you find the information that you were looking for?
Is that information complete? Does it conflict with other information?</p><ul><li>Copy the information to pedigree charts and family group sheets. These two 
forms are the staples of family history.</li>
<p></p><li>Organize the information. Use a filing system that works for you.</li>
<p></p><li>Share the information with interested family members.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>What Next?</b> Select a new objective and start the process over again
based on what you now know about your family. Before you know it, you're family 
history will unfold and you will be encouraged and excited.</p>
