					<font size="2"><b>IN ADDITION</b></font><br>
					<font size="2">Mitchell College has built its reputation on giving students an outstanding foundation in their college studies.  We are especially well known for our nationally respected Learning Resource Center (LRC) for students with diagnosed learning disabilities and/or ADD/ADHD and other related disabilities.  In fact, colleges and universities across the country have used Mitchell's LRC as a model in developing their own programs.  Because each Mitchell student has his or her own unique set of academic strengths and weaknesses, the LRC program addresses each participany on an individual basis.  Our small size enables Mitchell to offer an exceptionally personalized academic experience both in and out of the classroom.</font></p>

					</p>
					<p><br>
						<font color="navy" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular"><b>College Description</b></font><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular"><br>
						</font><font size="2" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Mitchell College is a private, coeducational, residential college offering twelve associate degree programs and a bachelor degree programs in Liberal/Professional Studies, Criminal Justice Human Development and Family Studies, Psychology, Early Childhood Education, and Business Administration. The College enrolls over 700 full-time students from across the country and around the world. Mitchell is dedicated to providing a student-centered supportive learning environment addressing the educational needs of all students including those with learning disabilities.</font></p>
					<p><font size="2" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">This philosophy comes to life through the Mitchell College community: a faculty that embraces the task of developing students' intellectual capabilities, a staff specifically trained for programs and services that encourage academic and personal growth, and fellow students who are also exploring and realizing their own potential.</font></p>
					<p><font size="2" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">The College was founded in 1938 and is accredited by the New England Association of Schools and Colleges. The campus is located on a beautiful 65-acre waterfront in the heart of the historic Mystic area shoreline in Southeastern Connecticut.</font></p>
					<p><font color="navy" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular"><b>Academic Life</b></font><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular"><br>
						</font><font size="2" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Mitchell's academic programs are founded in the liberal arts tradition and are relevant to today's world.  All students must take one course in expository writing, literature, mathematics, computer applications, psychology or sociology, speech, lab science, and wellness. </font></p>
					<p><font size="2" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Students undecided about their academic majors enroll in the Discovery Program, specifically designed to provide special courses, additional advising and services to realize their potential and settle on an academic major. All students are supported by the Tutoring Center which offers unlimited free tutoring staffed by professionals in every academic discipline.</font></p>
					<p><font size="2" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Students with diagnosed learning disabilities may enroll in the Learning Resource Center, which provides supplemental instruction and support along with a student's regular academic program.</font></p>
					<p><font size="2" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Semesters run from September to December and from January to May. Summer sessions are also available with limited course offerings.</font></p>
					<p><font color="navy" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular"><b>Campus Life</b></font><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular"><br>
						</font><font size="2" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Mitchell strongly encourages students to be involved in campus activities outside the classroom. It leads to personal growth in such areas as leadership, relationships, and citizenship. Participation in clubs, intramurals, dances, weekend trips off-campus, community service or catching the school spirit by cheering at an athletic event will lead to a good time too! Student clubs at Mitchell are a reflection of student, faculty, and staff interests. Currently, the following clubs are active on campus: bike, business, psychology, education, multicultural, ski, technology, and yearbook. Each year new clubs appear to match the interests of the Mitchell community. If you do not see a club you are interested in joining, you are encouraged to start one. Intramural sports are also a popular recreational outlet for students of all interests and abilities at the competitive and non-competitive levels. Coffeehouse performers, comedians, and other entertainment are regularly scheduled.</font></p>
					<p><font color="navy" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular"><b>Facilities and Resources</b></font><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular"><br>
						</font><font size="2" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Mitchell is nationally recognized for its C.A.R.E.S. model of student services. C.A.R.E.S. stands for Careering, Advising, Retaining, Educating, and Supporting, the five areas Mitchell has determined critical to student academic success. The C.A.R.E.S. program offers active support in all areas of a student's life at Mitchell, from orientation to graduation. The Tutoring Center, the Discovery Program, the Learning Resource Center, the Career and Transfer Center, and the Center for Student Academic Success are part of the C.A.R.E.S. model.</font></p>
					<p><font size="2" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">The campus includes a 45,000 volume library, two primary classroom instruction buildings, a fully equipped gymnasium, a fitness center, and indoor recreational areas. Our seven residence halls offer a variety of living styles - you can choose to live in one of three traditional residence halls or one of the four Victorian or Colonial homes on the waterfront. All rooms are equipped with dual telephone and computer jacks and Cable TV connections.</font></p>
					<p><font color="navy" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular"><b>Athletics/Sports</b></font><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular"><br>
						</font><font size="2" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">The Pequots have a tradition of winning many national and regional championships. Mitchell is a member of the National Junior College Athletic Association. Besides our regular fitness and wellness program, we field eleven intercollegiate teams involving approximately 30% of the students. Men play baseball, basketball, lacrosse, and soccer. Women play basketball, soccer, softball, and volleyball. Golf, tennis, and sailing are co-ed. A full schedule of intramural sports is organized for students of all athletic levels of experience and ability.</font></p>
					<p><font size="2" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">As a member of a varsity team, performance in the classroom takes precedence over athletics. Mitchell's S.T.A.R.S. (Students Taking Academic Responsibility Seriously) program was developed specifically for athletes to help them be successful in the classroom and the playing field.</font></p>
					<p><font color="navy" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular"><b>Financial Aid</b></font><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular"><br>
						</font><font size="2" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Mitchell annually awards more than $3 million in financial aid, both in need-based scholarships and in programs designed to recognize abilities in academics, athletics, leadership, and community service. Accepted students may qualify for grants and scholarships that do not need to be repaid. Self-help aid in the form of loans also is available. Campus job opportunities are plentiful for students, regardless of their financial aid status. MVP (Mitchell Valued Potential) scholarships are awarded based on an individual student's ability to contribute to the College. Athletic scholarships are available to students who participate in baseball, basketball, soccer, softball, and lacrosse. To be considered for financial aid, students must complete the FAFSA (Free Application for Federal Student Aid) and the College's own financial aid application.</font></p>
					<p><font color="navy" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular"><b>Admission Requirements</b></font><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular"><br>
						</font><font size="2" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Mitchell's admissions requirements are designed to help the College select those students best able to benefit from our educational experience. You must have graduated from high school or its equivalent, except in individual cases when after three years of high school, you are recommended as academically and socially prepared to enter college. In all cases we consider your academic performance and potential, recommendations, test information. The Committee on Admissions also recognizes students with different talents, contrasting backgrounds, and geographical origins. We admit students without regard to race, color, gender, disability, age, and national and ethnic origin.</font></p>
					<p><font size="2" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">You may file an application at any time during the year. We act upon applications promptly based on a plan of rolling admission because new students may enter the College in September, January, May, or July.</font></p>
					<p><font size="2" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">To apply for admission, you must file an application along with a $30 non-refundable fee. Ask your high school guidance office to forward your official high school record and letter(s) of recommendation and SAT and/or ACT scores. If you have attended college or other post-secondary programs, you must submit an official transcript from those institutions or programs. There are additional requirements for students entering the Learning Resource Center.</font></p>
