LUTAR-1#1 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell i_rst_adapt/FSM_onehot_state[3]_i_3, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) i_display_ctrl/FSM_onehot_state_reg[1]/CLR, i_display_ctrl/FSM_onehot_state_reg[2]/CLR, i_display_ctrl/FSM_onehot_state_reg[3]/CLR, i_display_ctrl/RClk_reg/CLR, i_display_ctrl/SClk_reg/CLR, i_display_ctrl/count_reg[0]/CLR, i_display_ctrl/count_reg[1]/CLR, i_display_ctrl/count_reg[2]/CLR, i_display_ctrl/count_reg[3]/CLR, i_display_ctrl/count_reg[4]/CLR, i_display_ctrl/enCounter_reg[0]/CLR, i_display_ctrl/enCounter_reg[1]/CLR, i_display_ctrl/enCounter_reg[2]/CLR, i_display_ctrl/enCounter_reg[3]/CLR, i_display_ctrl/secondsReg_reg[0]/CLR (the first 15 of 99 listed). The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
